### Disclaimer

Building this so my friends and I can play this awesome board game even if we don't have the physical game.

The game and rules are not mine. All taken from the actual board game "Secret Hilter"

Secret Hilter was created by Mike Boxleiter, TOmmy Maranges, Max Temkin, and Mac Schubert

## Overview

> At the beginning of the game, each player
  is secretly assigned to one of three roles:
  Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler. The Liberals have
  a majority, but they don’t know for sure who
  anyone is; Fascists must resort to secrecy and
  sabotage to accomplish their goals. Hitler plays
  for the Fascist team, and the Fascists know
  Hitler’s identity from the outset, but Hitler
  doesn’t know the Fascists and must work to
  figure them out.

> The Liberals win by enacting five Liberal
  Policies or killing Hitler. The Fascists win by
  enacting six Fascist Policies, or if Hitler is
  elected Chancellor after three Fascist Policies
  have been enacted.

> Whenever a Fascist Policy is enacted, the
  government becomes more powerful, and the
  President is granted a single-use power which
  must be used before the next round can begin. It
  doesn’t matter what team the President is on; in
  fact, even Liberal players might be tempted to
  enact a Fascist Policy to gain new powers.

### Overview in layman terms

### Narration Lines

For games of 5-6 Players
```
Everybody close your eyes.

Fascist and Hitler, open your eyes and acknowledge each other.

[ Take a long pause ]

Everyone close your eyes.

Everyone can open your eyes. If anyone is confused or something went wrong, please tell the group now.
```

For games of 7-10 Players
```
Everybody close your eyes and extend your hand into a fist in front of you.

All Fascists who are NOT Hitler should open their eyes and acknowledge each other.

Hitler - keep your eyes closed but put your thumb out into a thumbs-up gesture.

Fascists, take note of who has an extended thumb - that player is Hitler.

[ Take a long pause ]

Everyone close your eyes.

Everyone can open your eyes. If anyone is confused or something went wrong, please tell the group now.

## Gameplay

Secret Hitler is played in three rounds
  1. **Election** to form a government
  2. **Legislative Session** to enact a new Policy
  3. **Executive Action** to exercise governmental power

### Election
  1. Pass the presidential Candidacy
    The Presidential placard moves clockwise to the next player who becomes the new Presendential Candidate

  2. Nominate a Chancellor
    The Presidential Candidate chooses a Chancellor Candidate by passing the Chancellor placard to any other eligible player. The Presidential Candidate is free to discuss Chancellor options with the table to build consensus and increase the likelihood of the election succeeding

  > On Eligibility
  > Term limits apply to the President and Chancellor who were last elected, not to the last pair nominated.
  > Term limits only affect nominations to the Chancellorship; anyone can be President, even someone who was just Chancellor.
  >If there are only five players left in the game, only the last elected Chancellor is ineligible to be Chancellor Candidate; the last President may be nominated.

  3. Vote on the government
    Once the Presidential Candidate has chosen an eligible Chancellor Candidate, players may discuss the proposed government until everyone is ready to vote.
    Then every player, including the candidates, votes on the proposed government.

  **If the vote is a tie, or if a majority of the players votes no:**

  The vote fails.

  Presidential placard advances clockwise

  The Election Tracker is advanced by one Election.

  **Election Tracker:** fi the group rejects three governments in a row, the country is thrown into chaos. As a result of this chaos, the Top Policy card is immediately enacted. (Any power granted by this Policy is ignored, and the Election Tracker resets and existing term limits are forgotten)

  **If a majority of players votes yes:**

  The Presidential Candidate and Chancellor Candidate become the new President and Chancellor, respectively.

    *If three or more Fascist Policies have been enacted already:*
    *Ask if the new Chancellor is Hitler. If so, the game is over and Fascists win. Otherwise, other players know for sure the Chancellor is not Hilter*

  Proceed to the Legislative Session
