This has been a very fun project
That I do want to document everything and write down my honest experience for future constructive criticism

It has been fun building a project and iterating through this project
And getting customer experience about the UI and having the chops
To then go back into the code and make it better

Fun testing iterations of the product out. And getting feedback
