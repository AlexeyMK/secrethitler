Things I learned about Meteor.js

1. Hot code loading

Seems a lot less initial setup, you can get right to coding what you actually want
But maybe this limits the creativity or bandwidth later on, unsure.

Meteor 1.3 and beyond now include support for the /imports directory.
Unlike the /client and /server directories where all code is loaded automatically
  following a specific load order, any code within the project's /imports directory is not loaded automatically.
  This means that anything placed in this directory must be loaded explicitly in the application.
  Otherwise, our application won't see it.


2. CSS

p tags have automatic spacing above and beneath

remember order matters
what comes last will take precedence

3. Debugging in server side Meteor.js
  terminal: "meteor debug"
  open browser "http://localhost:8080/?port=5858"
  or whatever port the terminal prompts you to





Things to do
  - add in the special Presidential abilities
    policy Peek
    Execution
    legislative Loyalty
    call special election
  - add in veto power

  - play again logic, reset

  - add revealing what people voted "yes or no"



Bugs

1. current is after initial chancellor vote - vote failed
 - electiontracker displays
 - but there is no visual change or movement of the president placard
Solved
 - couldn't read property in votefailed/votepassed. Spelling error of roomId

2. Cannot read property 'playerId' of undefined.
Which means the undefined is room.players[room.currentChancellor].playerId
First time checking for chancellor in which the default has currentChancellor = -1
room.players[-1] <--- would equal undefined
Solved
 - another typo - main.js 271 players missing an 's'

3. Error invoking Method 'vote' (after three yes in a game of 3)
  update.policychoices wasn't defined in that scope
  need to pull from room.policychoices first then reupdate


4. Double clicking policy cards...seem to update one instance of the room to register more than once
    which can cause premature gameover
