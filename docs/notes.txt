Things I learned about Meteor.js

1. Hot code loading

Seems a lot less initial setup, you can get right to coding what you actually want
But maybe this limits the creativity or bandwidth later on, unsure.

Meteor 1.3 and beyond now include support for the /imports directory.
Unlike the /client and /server directories where all code is loaded automatically
  following a specific load order, any code within the project's /imports directory is not loaded automatically.
  This means that anything placed in this directory must be loaded explicitly in the application.
  Otherwise, our application won't see it.


2. CSS

p tags have automatic spacing above and beneath
